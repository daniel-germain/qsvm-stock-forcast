# Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) for Stock Prediction

**Status**: Work in Progress 🚧 

This repository contains an early-stage exploration of using Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for stock price prediction. I am essentially running two experiments: 

## Experiments

**Experiment 1**
The project applies quantum kernel methods to historical stock data to see if QSVM's would outperform classic SVM's when using fewer input features (no technical indicators)
since QSVM's can create a rich feature space without needing much data.

**Experiment 2**
It also seeks to expore if quantum entaglement methods can pick up subtle feature correlations when using technical indicators. 


## Goals
- Implement QSVM using Pennylane
- Compare performance with classical SVMs
- See how entaglement methods and technical indicators impact results. 

## Notes
- Code and results are in development.
- Final analysis and documentation are pending.
  

## Preliminary Results
Classic and Quantum SVM's had very similar performace. 

Initial experiments using a quantum support vector machine (QSVM)  indicate that quantum entanglement, as implemented through entangling feature maps, did not impact classification accuracy on the selected financial dataset.

## Next Steps 
- Tune Quantum Circut
- Benchmark against classic SVM while using progressivly less features.
- Test entaglement performance impact when using many technical indicator features.
