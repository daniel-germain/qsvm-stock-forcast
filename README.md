# Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) for Stock Prediction

**Status**: Work in Progress ðŸš§ (PAPER INBOUND ðŸ™‚)

This repository contains an early-stage exploration of using Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for stock price prediction. The project applies quantum kernel methods to historical stock data with the goal of understanding the practical performance and scalability of QSVMs in real-world financial applications.

## Goals
- Implement QSVM using Qiskit
- Compare performance with classical SVMs
- Evaluate feasibility of quantum approaches in finance

## Notes
- Code and results are in development.
- Final analysis and documentation are pending.
- HPC access needed for final results

## Preliminary Results

Initial experiments using a quantum support vector machine (QSVM)  indicate that quantum entanglement, as implemented through entangling feature maps, did not impact classification accuracy on the selected financial dataset.

### Observations
- Performance was comparable between entangled and non-entangled feature maps.
- The dataset's low dimensionality and limited size may have limited the expressive power of entanglement.

These preliminary findings suggest the need to explore more complex feature sets and higher-dimensional data where quantum entanglement may have a stronger effect on model performance.
