# Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) for Stock Prediction

**Status**: Work in Progress ðŸš§ (PAPER INBOUND ðŸ™‚)

This repository contains an early-stage exploration of using Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for stock price prediction. The project applies quantum kernel methods to historical stock data with the goal of understanding the practical performance and scalability of QSVMs in real-world financial applications.

## Goals
- Implement QSVM using Qiskit
- Compare performance with classical SVMs
- Evaluate feasibility of quantum approaches in finance

## Notes
- Code and results are in development.
- Final analysis and documentation are pending.
- HPC access needed for final results
