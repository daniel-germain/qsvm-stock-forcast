# Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) for Stock Prediction

**Status**: Work in Progress 🚧 

This repository contains an early-stage exploration of using Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for stock price prediction. I am essentially running two experiments: 

## Experiments

**Experiment 1**
The project applies quantum kernel methods to historical stock data to see how QSVM's compare to classic SVM's when using fewer input features (no technical indicators)
since QSVM's can create a rich feature space without needing much data. 

**Experiment 2**
It also seeks to expore if quantum entaglement methods can pick up subtle feature correlations when using technical indicators.
